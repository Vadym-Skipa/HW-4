1. Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes
2. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class and will have seating_capacity own method
3. Determine which class a given Bus object belongs to (Check type of an object)
4. Determine if School_bus is also an instance of the Vehicle class
5. Create a new class School with get_school_id and number_of_students instance attributes
6*. Create a new class SchoolBus that will inherit all of the methods from School and Bus and will have its own - bus_school_color
7. Polymorphism: Create two classes: Bear, Wolf. Both of them should have make_sound method. Create two instances, one of Bear and one of Wolf,
make a tuple of it and by using for call their action using the same method.
Magic methods:
8. Create class City with name, population instance attributes, return a new instance only when population > 1500,
otherwise return message: "Your city is too small".
9. Override a printable string representation of the City class and return: The population of the city {name} is {population}
10*. Override magic method __add__() to perform the additional action as 'multiply' (*) the value which is greater than 10. And perform this add (+) of two instances.
11. The __call__ method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function.
Create a new class with __call__ method and define this call to return sum.
12*. Making Your Objects Truthy or Falsey Using __bool__().
Create class MyOrder with cart and customer instance attributes.
Override the __bool__magic method considered to be truthy if the length of the cart list is non-zero.
e.g.:
order_1 = MyOrder(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'd')
order_2 = MyOrder([], 'a')
bool(order_1)
True
bool(order_2)
False
